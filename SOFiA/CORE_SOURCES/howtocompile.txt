This is a short guide how to compile the SOFiA sources (MEX). 

The toolbox releases come with PRECOMPILED CORES for Windows Matlab 32bit and 64bit and MAC OS-X. Using one of these operating systems you do not have to compile the cores (at least if you do not want to make any changes to the sourcecode).


Your need to compile the core:

	1. MATLAB e.g. 2010 - 2013 (it also should work with older versions)

	2. A C++ Compiler (e.g. Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express for Windows)

	3. The BOOST C++ Library, get it at http://www.boost.org/


- Install the C++ Compiler. 

- Place the BOOST Library to the folder: /MATLAB/Rxxxx/extern/include/ 
  ...way that the compiler can find the path "/MATLAB/Rxxxx/extern/include/boost/math/...".

- Type "> mex -setup" in Matlab and select the C++ compiler.


Once everything is placed, you are ready to compile the core:

Navigate to the SOFiA\CORE_SOURCES folder.
type "> sofia_buildAll" and all source files will be compiled into the SOFiA folder.

(Thanx to Nils Peters for the build-script)


Enjoy and best regards,
